promises_study
==============

This is my personal study for promises in JS using Q.js

All examples are self contained you will just need to install the Q.js and run
EX:
node file_name.js

I am trying to build examples for every function in Q.js, naming should be feature/method_ex

I feel happy about that. 

Rabbit will control the world.
